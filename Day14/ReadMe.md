Today I started a **real-time CI/CD project** focusing on **Continuous Integration (CI)**.  
The goal is to automatically build and test code when developers push to a repository.

## Set Up GitHub Repository
 - The first step in our CI journey is to set up a GitHub repository to store our Python application's source code. If you already have a repository, feel free to skip this step. Otherwise, let's create a new repository on GitHub by following these steps:

- Go to github.com and sign in to your account.
- Click on the "+" button in the top-right corner and select "New repository."
