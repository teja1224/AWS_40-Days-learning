# AWS Lambda HandsOn from console
Follow below steps to see about Lambda.

- Go to AWS Console → Lambda → Create Function.
- Choose Author from scratch.
- Runtime = Python 3.9 (for example).
- Execution Role = create new role with basic Lambda permissions.
- Write code in editor or upload zip file.
- Create a test event (JSON input).
- Run & check logs in CloudWatch Logs.

## Integration Examples
- Lambda + S3 → process uploaded files.
- Lambda + API Gateway → build a serverless REST API.
- Lambda + DynamoDB → real-time data processing.
- Lambda + SNS/SQS → event-driven messaging.

With Lambda, you can build serverless, cost-efficient, and scalable applications without managing infrastructure.
