# AWS CLI

Today I am going to learn about AWS CLI (command line interface).<br>
AWS CLI is super important once you start automating instead of clicking in the console.

## What is AWS CLI?
- **AWS CLI** is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with AWS services directly from your terminal or command prompt.
- Instead of using the AWS Management Console (UI), you can run commands to create, update, and manage AWS resources.
- It is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Benefits of AWS CLI
1. **Automation** → Useful for scripting and DevOps workflows.  
2. **Speed** → Faster than clicking through the AWS Console.  
3. **Consistency** → Same command works across environments.  
4. **Integration** → Works well with CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions).  
5. **Multi-Account & Multi-Region Support** → Easily switch profiles.
