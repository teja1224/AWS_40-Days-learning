Today, I want to work on AWS ECR.
# AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
- AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed container image registry service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
- It enables you to store, manage, and deploy container images (Docker images) securely, making it an essential component of your containerized application development workflow.
- ECR integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

## Key Benefits of ECR
- Security: ECR offers encryption at rest, and images are stored in private repositories by default, ensuring the security of your container images.
- Integration: ECR integrates smoothly with AWS services like ECS and EKS, simplifying the deployment process.
- Scalability: As a managed service, ECR automatically scales to meet the demands of your container image storage.
- Availability: ECR guarantees high availability, reducing the risk of image unavailability during critical times.
- Lifecycle Policies: You can define lifecycle policies to automate the cleanup of unused or old container images, helping you save on storage costs.
