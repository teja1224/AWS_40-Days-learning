# ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Basics ‚Äì Getting Started
Whenever we want to be an expert in a technology we should start from its roots, why its happened and what the usecases. So my day1 is all about learning AWS basics and understaning its terminology.

## 1. What is Cloud?

Cloud = **using computing resources (servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, AI, etc.) over the internet instead of owning physical hardware.**  

- Instead of buying and maintaining your own servers ‚Üí you rent them ondemand from cloud providers like **AWS, Azure, GCP**.  
- Pricing is **pay-as-you-go** (only pay for what you use).  

### Types of Cloud Computing Services
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Virtual machines, networking, storage (e.g., AWS EC2, S3).  
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Managed platforms for apps/databases (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, RDS).  
- **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Ready-to-use apps (e.g., Gmail, Salesforce).

## 2. Public vs Private Cloud

| Feature        | **Public Cloud**                                   | **Private Cloud**                               |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition** | Services offered over the internet by providers    | Infrastructure dedicated to one organization   |
| **Ownership**  | Owned by provider (AWS, Azure, GCP)               | Owned & managed by organization                |
| **Scalability**| Highly scalable, global reach                     | Limited by company hardware                    |
| **Cost**       | Pay-as-you-go, no upfront costs                   | High upfront cost & maintenance                |
| **Use Cases**  | Startups, SaaS apps, global web apps              | Banks, government, healthcare (compliance)     |

## 3. Why is public cloud so popular ?
- **Lower Cost:** No upfront infrastructure cost.
- **Scalability:** Scale up or down instantly.
- **Global Reach:** Data centers across the world.
- **Faster Innovation:** Access to AI/ML, IOT, serverless, etc.
- **Reliability & security:** Built-in redundancy, compliance, encryption.
- Companies like **Netflix, Airbnb, Uber** on AWS public cloud.

## 4. Why AWS?

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the **#1 cloud provider** (market leader since 2006).  

**Reasons AWS is widely adopted:**  
- **Largest global presence** ‚Üí 30+ regions, 95+ Availability Zones.  
- **Wide range of services** ‚Üí 200+ services (compute, storage, databases, AI, analytics, IoT).  
- **Flexible pricing** ‚Üí pay-as-you-go, reserved, spot pricing.  
- **Security & compliance** ‚Üí trusted by banks, governments, enterprises.  
- **Innovation** ‚Üí first to introduce services like Lambda (serverless).  
- **Community & Ecosystem** ‚Üí millions of customers, strong docs, certifications.

## 5. Trends of People Moving Back to Private Cloud

Some companies are considering **cloud repatriation** (moving workloads back to private cloud).  

**Reasons:**  
- **High Costs** ‚Üí Long-term public cloud bills can be higher.  
- **Security & Compliance** ‚Üí Sensitive industries prefer on-premises.  
- **Performance** ‚Üí Latency-sensitive apps may work better locally.  
- **Predictable Costs** ‚Üí For steady workloads, private infra can be cheaper.  

üëâ But overall, the **majority trend is still towards cloud adoption**, especially **hybrid cloud** (mix of public + private).

## 6. AWS Account
At the end of day1, I understand the overall usage of AWS and its importance in present day tech. I have created a AWS free tier account for personal use to learn about it.
